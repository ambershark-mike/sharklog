#### 0.4
- Restructured object relationships.  NOTE: This breaks the ABI from previous versions.   I found that during design I had made a major mistake a related Layouts to a Logger and not to a specific Outputter.  I had to rectify this.  Unfortunately it breaks the ABI for previous versions.  Luckily it looks like nobody has used it before this version so it's fine anyway. ;)
